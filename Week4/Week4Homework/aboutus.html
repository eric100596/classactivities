    <h3>About Us</h3>
    Gospel Bound Ministries is an autonomous church affiliated 
    with Sovereign Adventists. We use the King James Version of 
    the Holy Bible as our standard, and believe as Matthew 4:4 states, 
    that "man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." 
    We meet each Sabbath at 10:30 for bible study, and every other Friday we have "Game Night". In addition to bible studies and games, the church has produced several games and activities designed to not only teach participants about how the bible can be used as a way of life, but we have 
    also produced a biblical reference text called "Spiritual Sovereignty: The Light of Love". The textbook is a "how-to" for daily spiritual living, with an emphasis on living prosperously in the world while not being a part of it.
